---

Last night [Brian Tai](https://github.com/btai24){:target="_blank"} and I had the pleasure of hosting HashiCorp at our 4th installment of West LA DevOps hosted at GumGum HQ. We had two speakers from HashiCorp, including our first female speaker [Jasmine Dahilig](https://github.com/jazzyfresh){:target="_blank"} (Software Engineer)! Jasmine's talk was entitled "Dancing with Data and Distributed Systems" and [Jake Lundberg](https://github.com/grove-mountain){:target="_blank"} (Staff Solutions Engineer) also spoke about creating service meshes using Consul.

We also had our 3rd "Industry Updates" segment where we provided a concise overview of some of the major happenings in DevOps and software in general. Check out our slides below for our most recent updates!
