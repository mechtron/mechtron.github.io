- [Tech Debt: The Bill Comes Due](https://adamcoster.medium.com/tech-debt-the-bill-comes-due-fdcef2cecf05){:target="_blank"} by Adam Coster: if we don‚Äôt solve the problems of our past, the futures that we want become ever more difficult to obtain. That‚Äôs true in life, and it‚Äôs true in software. In life, the past comes in the form of baggage. In software, we call that ‚Äútechnical debt‚Äù. For both life and software, how do you deal with the past? Do you ignore it and hope for the best? Do you continuously make your future better, via therapy and code refactoring? Do you cut ties with the past completely, via moving to another city and starting a new git repository?

That‚Äôs why many companies rewrite their applications in another language once Python‚Äôs speed becomes a bottleneck for users. But what if there was a way to keep Python‚Äôs awesome features and improve its speed? Enter PyPy.
