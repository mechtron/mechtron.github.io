title: "DevOps Industry Updates #16"
---

AWS re:Invent 2020 is officially underway and we've already seen some alluring new products like Mac EC2 instances, gp3 EBS volumes, public ECR Docker registries (sorry, DockerHub) and a crazy database translation layer called BabelFish.

But if you thought the drama ended there, well, you might be new to DevOps! We also learned that the next version of Kubernetes (v1.20) will be the last to include the (gasp!) Docker container runtime. Should you be worried? Well, no. But you can read all about that saga (and so much more) in this action-packed issue of DevOps Industry Updates:
